All the python codes use python version 2.7.


A. crimePrediction/ : 

1. scipt.sh : script to test model for predicting crime using past data

Change parameters in this file to get results for different parameters.
Check the different component files for more flexibility.

B. crimePrediction/clustering/ :

1. clustering.py - This file takes a numpy data file(produced by ???) as input. The input file contains crime locations in a particular region. Using DBSCAN clustering, this code produces two numpy files, namely cluster_matrix and cluster_cells. The cluster information is used in linear regression prediction.

Usage : python clustering.py rows cols epsilon min_samples


2. correlation_clustering.py: This file takes a numpy data file as input. The input file contains a matrix which contains the time series of the crime in respective grid cells. This code prepares a correlation cell matrix.

Usage : python correlation_clustering.py rows cols time_period lookback

3. crimePrediction.py: This code is deprecated. Use crimePredictionKFold.py instead.

4. crimePredictionKFold.py: This code uses regression to predict crime frequency.
Input : A matrix where each cell corresponds to the grid cell. Each cell contains a time series which represents the 
number of crime incidents in a particular period of time.(may be 1 day or a week or a month,...)

kFold cross validation has been used

5. crimePredictionNBM.py : NBM model does not work for all data. Needs to be checked.

6. divideBtTimeClustering.py : Load crime grid data and divide into time periods and save for prediction code.

7. gridClustering.py : Naive implementation of a grid clustering algorithm and using the clusters for prediction.

Usage : python gridClustering.py rows cols time_period lookback threshold

8. ra_metric.py : This code calculates the resource allocation metric 

Input : 2 pickle files

Output : graph of number of crimes captured


9. ra_improved.py : This code calculates the resource allocation metric 
Algorithm:
1. Select the cell with minimum area.
2. Assign as many resources possible to it subject to requirements
3. Repeat this step until the resources are finished or all the cells are covered.

Input : 2 pickle files

Output : graph of number of crimes captured


10. script_clustering.py :A script to test model while varying parameters

Give executable permission first - chmod +x script_clustering.sh
Usage : ./script_clustering.sh
